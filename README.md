Student Success Services and Supports

ADA Accommodations
Dakota State University strives to ensure that physical resources, as well as information and communication technologies, are reasonably accessible to users to provide equal access to all. If you encounter any accessibility issues, you are encouraged to immediately contact the instructor of the course and Dakota State University's Office of Disability Services, which will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

DSU's Office of Disability Services is located in the Learning Engagement Center and can be contacted by calling 605-256-5121 or emailing dsu-ada@dsu.edu. Students seeking ADA accommodations (such as non-standard note taking or extended time and/or a quiet space taking exams and quizzes) can access the DSU website https://dsu.edu/student-life/disability-services/index.html for additional information and the link to the Disability Services Request Form. You will need to provide documentation of your disability and the ADA Coordinator must confirm the need before officially authorizing accommodations.
DSU Knowledge Base
The DSU Knowledge Base contains links and resources to help students by providing information about the following topics: User Accounts & Passwords, Academic Tools & Resources, Software & Apps Support, WiFi & Network Access, Campus Emergency Alert System, Campus Printing, IT Security & Safe Computing, and the Support Desk (which is there to help both on and off-campus students). The Knowledge Base can be accessed through the link below:
•	DSU Knowledge Base

D2L Support for Students
The D2L Support for Students site is designed to provide DSU students a D2L support resource center that contains user guides, tutorials, and tips for using the D2L learning environment. The D2L Support for Students site can be accessed through the link below:
•	DSU D2L Support Resources for Students

Classroom Policies

Attendance and Make-up Policy
Assignments must be turned in on time. Late assignments will not be accepted, no exceptions.

Students are expected to check their DSU email and the D2L course site daily to ensure important changes or assignment updates are communicated.

Note: It is the unfortunate truth that major life events (e.g. demise of a loved one) may pull us away from learning objectives and schedules. Please let me know as soon as possible if you are experiencing or expect to experience such an event and I will be more than happy to work with you. This communication needs to happen before deadlines of assignments, quizzes, tests, etc. to be able to accommodate your situation. 

DSU Policies

Complaint Procedure
Dakota State University seeks to resolve student concerns and complaints in a fair and prompt manner. Students may file a complaint using the DSU Concerns and Feedback form.  SARA complaints from out-of-state students may be filed using the procedures noted here.
Grade Appeal Policy
If a student believes the final grade assigned in a course was inappropriate, he/she may appeal that grade by filing a formal grade appeal within 15 days of the start of the next academic session. Please see the DSU policy on Appealing Academic and Administrative Decisions for the required process and form to appeal a final grade.
Student Verification Statement and Proctoring Policy
Federal law requires that universities verify the identity of students when course materials and/or course assessment activities are conducted either partially or entirely online. A student’s Desire2Learn (D2L) login and password are intended to provide the student with secure access to course materials and are also intended to help the university meet this federal mandate. Some DSU Faculty also require the use of a proctor for exams in distance-delivered (Internet) courses and this requirement provides a second level of student identity verification. Students are responsible for any proctoring fees, if applicable. Finally, an instructor who uses web conferencing technology may require students to use a webcam during exams as another means of student identity verification through voice and visual recognition.

South Dakota Board of Regents Policy Statements

Freedom in Learning Statement
Under Board of Regents and Regental Institutions policy, student academic performance may be evaluated solely on an academic basis, not on opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards. Discussion and debate are critical to education and professional development. Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled. While the exploration of controversial topics may be an important component of meeting the student learning outcomes in a course, no student will be compelled or directed to personally affirm, adopt, or adhere to any divisive concepts (as defined in SDCL 13-1-67). Students who believe that an academic evaluation reflects prejudiced or capricious consideration of student opinions or conduct unrelated to academic standards should contact their home institution to initiate a review of the evaluation.
ADA Statement
The Regental Institutions strive to ensure that physical resources, as well as information and communication technologies, are reasonably accessible to users to provide equal access to all. If you encounter any accessibility issues, you are encouraged to immediately contact the instructor of the course and the Office of Disability Services, which will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Please note: if your home institution is not the institution you are enrolled at for a course (host institution), then you should contact your home institution’s Office of Disability services. The disability services at the home and host institution will work together to ensure your request is evaluated and responded to in a timely manner.
Academic Dishonesty and Misconduct
Cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty and misconduct run contrary to the purposes of higher education and will not be tolerated. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism, copying answers or work done by another student (either on an exam or an assignment), allowing another student to copy from you, and using unauthorized materials during an exam. The Regental Institution’s policy and procedures on cheating and academic dishonesty can be found in your home institution’s Student Handbook and the governing Board of Regents policies can be found in BOR Policy 2.9.2 and BOR Policy 3.4.1. The consequences for cheating and academic dishonesty are outlined in policy. 

Any form of academic dishonesty will result in failure of the course. Students are not allowed to submit work that was attempted or completed in a prior offering of the course. Resubmitted work will be considered self-plagiarism and will not be accepted. Instances of academic dishonesty may cause prior submitted/graded submissions to be reevaluated for academic dishonesty.
Acceptable Use of Technology
Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources: While Regental Institutions strive to provide access to computer labs and other technology, it is the student’s responsibility to ensure adequate access to the technology required for a course. This may include access to a computer (not Chromebooks, iPads, etc.), webcam, internet, adequate bandwidth, etc. While utilizing any of the information technology systems students, faculty and staff should observe all relevant laws, regulations, BOR Policy 7.1, and any institutional procedural requirements.
Emergency Alert Communication
In the event of an emergency arising on campus under BOR Policy 7.3, your Regental Home Institution will notify the campus community via the emergency alert system. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that their information is updated in the emergency alert system. The student’s cell phone will be automatically inserted if available and if not, their email address is loaded. Students can at any time update their information the student alert system.
